# 🛡️ Insurance Claims Operations Dashboard

A comprehensive Power BI report designed to analyse insurance claims data, enhance operational oversight, and identify fraud and risk patterns across regions.

## 📊 Project Overview

The Insurance Claims Operations Dashboard was developed to enable data-driven decision-making by visualising key metrics related to claim handling, agent/vendor performance, and regional risk analysis.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Power BI** – Interactive visualisation and dashboard development
- **Excel** – Data preprocessing and modelling
- **ArcGIS for Power BI** – Geospatial heatmaps for regional risk insights
- **DAX** – Dynamic calculations and custom measures

## 🎯 Objectives

- Present a high-level executive summary of claim operations
- Monitor performance of agents and vendors across multiple regions
- Detect regional claim concentration and potential fraud hotspots
- Provide actionable insights to optimise claims handling

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Executive Summary Page:** KPIs such as total claims, claims processed, fraud rate, and average resolution time
- **Operational Performance:** Breakdown of claims handled by individual agents and vendors, visualised with bar and pie charts
- **Regional Risk Analysis:** ArcGIS heatmap showing regional distribution of claims, aiding in location-based risk detection
- **Tooltips & Info Icons:** Page-level summaries and definitions embedded for user guidance
- **Export-ready Visuals:** PDF snapshot support and image export capabilities

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Ingestion:** Imported structured Excel files into Power BI
2. **Data Transformation:** Cleaned and modelled data using Power Query
3. **KPI Calculations:** Built DAX measures for metrics like fraud percentage, claim turnaround time, and vendor efficiency
4. **Geo-mapping:** Integrated ArcGIS for spatial claim concentration analysis
5. **UI/UX Design:** Enhanced interactivity with slicers, dynamic titles, and embedded tooltips

## ✅ Results & Impact

- Can Empower leadership to take quick, evidence-based decisions
- Improved visibility into vendor and agent efficiency
- Identified high-risk regions enabling targeted fraud prevention strategies
- Can reduced manual reporting efforts significantly


## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop
2. Ensure ArcGIS integration is enabled to view geospatial visuals
3. Navigate through tabs to explore executive, operational, and risk insights
4. Use slicers and filters to customise the view by region, agent, or claim type

## 📌 Note

Due to technical limitations, the ArcGIS heatmap may not appear in PDF exports.
